  Computations of course have been performed since ancient times. One can 
  trace back the termin ``computer'' applied to humans at least until 1613.

  The ``Harvard computers'' became very famous in this context. Incidently, they were
  mostly female. They predate the NASA human computers of recent movie fame.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Once again Hamming}

  \ldots{}of ``Hamming code'' and ``Hamming distance'' fame, who started
  his carrier programming in Los Alamos:

  ``Indeed, one of my major complaints about the computer field is that
  whereas Newton could say,''If I have seen a little farther than others,
  it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants," I am forced to
  say, ``Today we stand on each other's feet.'' Perhaps the central
  problem we face in all of computer science is how we are to get to the
  situation where we build on top of the work of others rather than
  redoing so much of it in a trivially different way. Science is supposed
  to be cumulative, not almost endless duplication of the same kind of
  things." (1968)
